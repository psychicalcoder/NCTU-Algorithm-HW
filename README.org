* Problem Sets
  These codes are the AC solutions of 2020 Fall Pf. Kai-Chiang Wu's Introduction to Algorithms course in NCTU CS.
  Includes problems in lab1 to lab6 except the midterm problems (because I didn't do them).
  The problem sets can be found on [[https://oj.nctu.edu.tw/groups/30/bulletins/][FormosaOJ]] if you can login.
* Environment Recommendation
** Editor
  GNU Emacs 27.1 with LSP-mode + Clangd
** Compile command and options
  This is my compilation setting, but I think the code is compatible for C++ Version above C++11 (both clang++ and g++).
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  g++ 1075.cpp -std=c++14 -O2 -o 1075
#+END_SRC
